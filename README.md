    A true warrior masters his sword and his mind. A ‘code warrior’ masters his software and his
    system. Mastering your software is not the most difficult part, just read the quick-start and
    off you go. Mastering the system that makes your software function, however, can take a
    lifetime.

1.  Best Practices

2.  Modules

    -   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF3LaRqgXo>  - Publishing (Perfect) Python Packages on PyPi
    -   <https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python>  - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.
    -   <https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-underrated-python-packages-e22bf6049b5e>
        some surprising little packages:
        -   <https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock>  - get notified when your training/function ends
        -   <https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy>  - fix somehow broken unicode characters
    -   <https://github.com/jpvanhal/inflection>  - string transformation library. It singularizes and pluralizes English words, and transforms strings from CamelCase to underscored string.
    -   <https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload>  - nice file watcher
    -   <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>  - Python logging made (stupidly) simple
        Loguru is a library which aims to bring enjoyable logging in Python.
        
        Did you ever feel lazy about configuring a logger and used print() instead?&#x2026; I did, yet
        logging is fundamental to every application and eases the process of debugging. Using Loguru you
        have no excuse not to use logging from the start, this is as simple as from loguru import
        logger.
        
        Also, this library is intended to make Python logging less painful by adding a bunch of useful
        functionalities that solve caveats of the standard loggers. Using logs in your application
        should be an automatism, Loguru tries to make it both pleasant and powerful.
    -   <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>  - standardize testing in Python
    -   <https://github.com/rubik/radon> and <https://github.com/rubik/xenon>  - measure and test program complexity
    -   <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>  - framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production
    -   <https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-pythons-datatable-package-5d3a97394ee9>
    -   <https://github.com/ray-project/ray>  - seems to be an elegant alternative to celery
    
    -   Blog <https://towardsdatascience.com/modern-parallel-and-distributed-python-a-quick-tutorial-on-ray-99f8d70369b8>
    -   Documentation <https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
    
    I&rsquo;m not completely sure about the differences,
    but it looks it&rsquo;s much easier to setup and maintain.
    Also, the DAG handling is nicer on first look.
    
    One of the subprojects is a seamless pandas scaling framework [modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin)!
    
    -   <https://medium.com/better-programming/python-celery-best-practices-ae182730bb81>
    -   <https://github.com/modin-project/modin>  - scale your pandas workflows by changing one line of code

3.  Debugging

4.  Documentation

    -   <https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-5-documentation-13219991028c>
        Tools:
        -   <https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings> - adds an extension for the fantastic pydocstyle tool to flake8.
        -   <https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint>  - linter which checks that the docstring description matches the definition.
        -   <https://github.com/Erotemic/xdoctest>  - testing the examples in the docstrings

    Note, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to give customers access to django admin panels (it&rsquo;s really only for internal purposes).
    For externals, just give a REST API and HyperlinkedModelSerializer view.

    -   **picture:** to have alternative imgs depending on media without all the css/js mash
    -   **progress:** progressbars just in plain html
    -   **base:** don&rsquo;t forget it :-)
    -   **input type=&ldquo;&#x2026;&rdquo;:** we have plain html date, datetime-local, month, week, time, color, range input types
    -   **details:** includes <summary> and only clicking on details shows all, again pure html
    -   **mark:** use it instead of <span class=&ldquo;&#x2026;&rdquo;> to mark something
    -   **abbr:** easy to forget, but very useful
    -   **div contenteditable:** to create an editable field (and get rid of textarea)

    1.  Tell Bash to Run in Safe Mode
        
            # start your script with
            #!/bin/bash -eu

            #!/usr/bin/env bash
            set -o errexit
            set -o nounset
    
    2.  Try to use the long form of options
    
    3.  Use Quotes around the variables
    
    4.  Don&rsquo;t write Programs (more than 100 lines of code => use python instead)
    
    5.  Give helpful error messages (<https://levelup.gitconnected.com/helpful-errors-in-bash-scripts-c1e3c2c50bf8>)

    1.  Use visuals in your postmortems
        Graphs like when the incidents happened
        -   Better to understand for newcomers what&rsquo;s going on
        -   In future engineers have something they already have seen before and can compare
    2.  Be a historian
        -   Show timelines
    3.  Publish promptly (aim <= 48h)
        -   More accurate (who can remember anything weeks or months old)
        -   Otherwise people thing everything is out of control and fill the gap with (miserable) products you don&rsquo;t want
    4.  Be blameless
    5.  Tell a (complete) story (not only for insiders)

    builder docker image to compile, test and create artefacts and also to
    generate an application container

### Cloud Provisioners

1.  For all platforms

    -   <https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke>  - get rid of all allocated resources, finally!
    -   <https://medium.com/@nandovillalba/why-i-think-gcp-is-better-than-aws-ea78f9975bda>

2.  AWS

    -   <https://medium.com/teamzerolabs/5-aws-services-you-should-avoid-f45111cc10cd>
        1.  Cognito (User Management/Mobile Login)
            -   No Mobile
            -   Use one of the competitors OAuth2 from Google/Facebook/w/e
        2.  CloudFormation
            -   Obviously a huge mess -> use Terraform instead
        3.  ElasticCache
            -   just very expensive for a simple redis server (that intents to hold ephemoral data anywhere)
            -   just deploy it to an ec2 or similar and if HA is needed setup a load balancer in front
        4.  Kinesis
            -   difficult to setup (some java foo stuff with explicit dependencies to bundle into python stuff and more creepy actions)
            -   just use one of the messaging queue alternatives like celery, rabbitmq, kafka, &#x2026;
        5.  Lambda
            -   great to handle triggers (like update to s3 or w/e)
            -   terrible to run http rest endpoints (no solid monitoring, logging, unclear environment it&rsquo;s running and so on)
                -> just use a real framework like flask, fastapi, django w/e or kubeless

including:

-   **Asynchronous Request and Reply:** polling or event notification

        -   Docker Trusted Registry
        -   Dockerd With User Namespaces (no privileged running)
        -   Hyper-V Isolation (docker run -it &#x2013;isolation=hyperv &#x2026;)
        -   Dockerfile Verification (docker history, dive, &#x2026;)
        -   Basic Virus Scan (Create docker container without running, export it and scan the image)
        -   Low Level Running Container Analysis (sysdig tool, let container for some
            time and check what expected system and network calls and do the same in the
            CI/CD pipeline)
        -   Seccomp Profiles and Capabilities
        -   CVE Scanning (e.g. via Clair)
        -   CIS Benchmarks (CIS = Center for Internet Security) &#x2013;> look for tools similiar to docker-bench-security/kube-bench

            Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing
            container and restart it with the same options that were used when it was
            deployed initially.

        1.  Run your containers with AllowPrivilegeEscaltion=false. It will make your
            seccomp profiles smaller and less likely to be impacted by container
            runtime changes.
        2.  Set your seccomp profiles at container level
        3.  Create application-specific seccomp profiles. If you can&rsquo;t do that, go for
            application type seccomp profiles, for example create a superset profile
            that encompass all your golang web api applications. As a last resort use
            runtime/default
        4.  No container in your cluster should run as seccomp=unconfined, specially in
            production environments
        5.  Create audit mode profiles to test in production by mixing a blacklist with
            a whitelist and logging all exceptions.
        6.  Allow the system calls you know you need, block everything else
        7.  Be comprehensive and make sure all the basic system calls have been whitelisted

        2.  If You Go Off The Beaten Path, Prepare For Pain
            Defaults work fine. Off-Defaults will need serious development and debugging time
        3.  Build Up A Good Mental Glossary Istio has its own vocabulary: Cluster,
            registry, even ingress is subtle different to what it is used commonly and
            also used in Kubernetes
            Documentation is a bit git-like, it&rsquo;s compact and understandable once you understand it.

2.  Anti-Patterns

    -   <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/security-architecture-anti-patterns>
        1.  &rsquo;Browse-up’ for administration
            -   When administration of a system is performed from a device which is less trusted than the
                system being administered. ​
            -   A better approach: ‘browse-down’
        2.  Management bypass
            -   When layered defences in a network data plane can be short-cut via the management plane.​
            -   A better approach: layered defences in management planes
        3.  Back-to-back firewalls
            -   When the same controls are implemented by two firewalls in series, sometimes from different
                manufacturers.
            -   A better approach: do it once, and do it well
            -   The one exception: There is one example of using two firewalls back-to-back that makes more
                sense; to act as a contract enforcement point between two entities that are connecting to
                each other.
        4.  Building an ‘on-prem’ solution in the cloud
            -   When you build - in the public cloud - the solution you would have built in your own data
                centres.
            -   A better approach: use higher order functions
        5.  Uncontrolled and unobserved third party access
            -   When a third party has unfettered remote access for administrative or operational purposes,
                without any constraints or monitoring in place.
            -   A better approach: a good contract, constrained access and a thorough audit trail
        6.  The un-patchable system
            -   When a system cannot be patched due to it needing to remain operational 24/7.
            -   A better approach: design for &rsquo;easy&rsquo; maintenance, little and often
    -   <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/protect-your-management-interfaces>
        1.  Protecting devices used for administration
            -   Ensure privileged users carry out their administrative duties in a ‘clean’ (more trusted)
                environment.
            -   Ensure privileged users handle their email and web browsing in a separate ‘dirty’ (less
                trusted) environment.
            -   Consider the ‘dirty’ environment to be sacrificial, and design it in a way that anticipates
                compromise. When it is compromised, you’d like to be able to find out when and how (and be
                able to easily recover it into a good state), but the breach shouldn&rsquo;t have a big impact on
                your important systems.
            -   Use strong authentication mechanisms, such as 2-factor authentication.
        2.  Reducing the exposure of management interfaces
            -   Expose management interfaces to dedicated management networks where you can. At the very
                least, limit authorised inbound IP addresses to those used by dedicated management devices.
            -   Deploy jump servers where you need to expose management interfaces to less trusted networks.
                Ensure these are very well configured and maintained.
            -   Use only the latest versions of secure protocols and configure them to use strong
                authentication mechanisms. For example, use the latest version of SSH rather than Telnet,
                and use public-key authentication to secure access.
            -   Create similar tiers in your management networks to those in the systems being managed.
            -   Collect and automatically alert on security-relevant events against your management
                infrastructure.
        3.  Ensuring there&rsquo;s a trail of breadcrumbs
            -   Record the commands issued by users on jump servers, and store them securely.
            -   Ensure all network and server infrastructure audit records are also kept securely.
            -   Send these records to a service that administrators don&rsquo;t have readily available access to,
                and would need multiple people to modify.
            -   Automate the analysis of logs to identify suspicious behaviour.

        > On balance we think well-engineered SaaS is better for security than the alternatives.
        
        > Consider whether your IT security engineering team is going to be better or worse at security
          management for a major commodity product, offered - as a service - by the major vendor who
          developed it.
        
        > SaaS offerings may feel at times like an uncontrolled and uncontrollable space where your
          staff will share private data in an unconstrained fashion. Our experience is that this can be
          true, but that it’s better to provide them with easy to understand guidance on which tools are
          appropriate to use, and where to seek help, rather than to ban them altogether.
        
        > I assert it is better to spend our local security effort on problems unique to our
          organisations, rather than worrying about patching, maintaining, and monitoring services that
          others can do better than us.
        
        > In summary, I would like to leave you with the message that whilst SaaS is not a silver bullet
          for cyber security, in many situations the security benefits outweigh the risks.

    luckily, Data World has 3667 free health datasets you can use for your next project.

-   <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php>  - UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators
    used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning
    algorithms. The archive was created as an ftp archive in 1987 by David Aha and fellow graduate
    students at UC Irvine. Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators, and
    researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning data sets. As an
    indication of the impact of the archive, it has been cited over 1000 times, making it one of the
    top 100 most cited “papers” in all of computer science.

### Data Testing

-   <https://great-expectations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html> - helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity by offering pipeline tests.
    Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead
    of compile or deploy time). Pipeline tests are like unit tests for datasets:
    they help you guard against upstream data changes and monitor data quality.
