  Loguru is a library which aims to bring enjoyable logging in Python.

  Did you ever feel lazy about configuring a logger and used print() instead?... I did, yet
  logging is fundamental to every application and eases the process of debugging. Using Loguru you
  have no excuse not to use logging from the start, this is as simple as from loguru import
  logger.

  Also, this library is intended to make Python logging less painful by adding a bunch of useful
  functionalities that solve caveats of the standard loggers. Using logs in your application
  should be an automatism, Loguru tries to make it both pleasant and powerful.

 Give the idea to re-randomize layers or re-initialize top-layers and measure re-randomization or
 re-initialization robustness to find a "best" iteration stop. As big DL models won't really
 overfit in classical sense of increasing error again at some point in training, but still start
 to memorize etc.

used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning
algorithms. The archive was created as an ftp archive in 1987 by David Aha and fellow graduate
students at UC Irvine. Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators, and
researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning data sets. As an
indication of the impact of the archive, it has been cited over 1000 times, making it one of the
top 100 most cited “papers” in all of computer science.
